## Image 1: Key Findings and Recommendations

### Strengths

- **Product Image**: 
  - The product image is large, centrally placed, and visually appealing, naturally drawing user attention. üì∑
  - **Heatmap Correlation**: High fixation on the product image supports its effectiveness in capturing user attention.
  
- **Product Name and Price**:
  - Prominent and directly aligned with the user‚Äôs natural F-pattern reading path. üè∑Ô∏èüí≤
  - **Heatmap Correlation**: Significant attention focused on the product name and price confirms their visibility and effective placement in the UI.
  
- **'Add to Basket' Button**:
  - Clearly labeled and strategically positioned. üõí
  - **Heatmap Correlation**: User attention is drawn here as seen in the heatmap, supporting its strategic placement for effective conversion.

### Weaknesses

- **Text Under 'Specifications' and 'Technical Details'**:
  - **Issue**: Lacks emphasis, making it less noticeable.
  - **Heatmap Correlation**: Sparse fixation in these areas indicates users skipping or missing the details.
  - **Severity**: Medium
  - **Impact**: Users may miss detailed product information.
  - **Recommendations**: Enhance text contrast, use bullet points or visual markers. Ensure contrast ratio meets WCAG 4.5:1.

- **Side Navigation Bar**:
  - **Issue**: Receives insufficient attention due to low contrast and poor placement.
  - **Heatmap Correlation**: Lack of user focus can be seen in the heatmap.
  - **Severity**: High
  - **Impact**: Could hinder easy access to site-wide features.
  - **Recommendations**: Increase contrast and reposition the navigation bar within the user‚Äôs natural navigation flow.

### WCAG Standards

- The UI partially meets WCAG 2.1 standards at the AA level. Improving text size and contrast in less attended sections would enhance accessibility. üìö

### Strengths

- **Product Image**: 
  - Large and centrally placed, capturing initial user attention. üñºÔ∏è
  - **Heatmap Correlation**: Heavy user focus confirms its effectiveness.

- **Product Name and Price**:
  - Clearly visible, easy to read, and conform to natural reading patterns. üí¨
  - **Heatmap Correlation**: Shows significant fixation, indicating successful communication of core information.
  
- **Ratings and Reviews**:
  - Prominently displayed, leveraging social proof to enhance credibility. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
  - **Heatmap Correlation**: User attention aligns with this critical area.

### Weaknesses

- **Color Selection Buttons**:
  - **Issue**: Small and less prominent.
