# UI Recommendations Report

## Image 1

### Strengths
- **Large Product Image:** The product image is large, centrally placed, and visually appealing, adhering to the F-pattern often observed in user eye movements on web pages. It captures attention and provides a quick visual representation of the product. üéØ
- **Prominent Product Title:** The product title is prominently displayed with a larger font size, making it highly visible and easily readable. üìï
- **Clear Price Display:** The price is displayed in a clear and prominent font, immediately below the product name. üí∞

### Heatmap Correlation
- High fixation on the product image confirms its effectiveness in capturing user attention.
- Concentrated attention on the product title demonstrates that users readily identify and read the product's name.
- Noticeable attention on the price indicates that users are actively considering the cost.

### Weaknesses
- **Understated 'More Info' Link:** The 'More Info' link is understated and located below the product description, lacking visual prominence.
  - **Reason:** Low visibility may lead users to overlook important product information.
  - **Recommendations:**
    - Increase font size and change to a more contrasting color.
    - Transform it into a button-style link for better visibility.

- **Color Selection Options:** The color selection options (Brown, Black, White) lack strong visual differentiation.
  - **Reason:** Small swatches are positioned closely together.
  - **Recommendations:**
    - Increase the size of the color swatches.
    - Add a thin border around each swatch to enhance visual separation.

- **Small Navigation Arrows:** The arrows for image carousel navigation are small and placed close to the product.
  - **Reason:** Users struggle to navigate effectively through product images.
  - **Recommendations:**
    - Increase the size of the navigation arrows.
    - Place them farther away from the product image for clarity.

### WCAG Standards
The UI likely meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA but requires a detailed audit for full compliance, with a focus on color contrast ratios and keyboard navigation.

### Heatmap Correlation
- High level of attention on the 'View gallery' area indicates that users are interested in seeing more product visuals.

### Weaknesses
- **Color Swatch Size and Proximity:** The color swatches for selecting headphone colors are small and positioned closely.
  - **Reason:** Difficult for users to accurately select their desired color, particularly on touch devices.
  - **Recommendations:**

    - Improve visual separation with spacing or outlines.
