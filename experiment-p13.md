   - A minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 should be targeted for all text areas.

2. **Increase Engagement in Specification Sections**:
   - Consider repositioning or using visual cues (e.g., icons, highlights) to draw attention.

3. **Regular WCAG Compliance Review**:
   - Frequent audits to ensure all content maintains accessibility compliance.

These improvements will ensure an accessible and user-centered design, enhancing both usability and user engagement.
