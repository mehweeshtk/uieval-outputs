*   **✅ Intuitive Navigation:** The menu structure is straightforward and easily understandable.

#### Weaknesses
*   **⚠️ Low Contrast:** The text color against the background has low contrast, potentially causing readability issues for users with visual impairments.
    *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Impact:** Reduced accessibility and user experience.
    *   **Heatmap Correlation:**  Low contrast values in specific areas of the screen.
    *   **Recommendations:** Increase contrast between text and background using a color contrast analyzer tool. Ensure sufficient space around text elements.
*   **❓ Confusing Iconography:** Some icons are ambiguous and may not be easily understood by all users.
    *   **Severity:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** User confusion and potential errors.
    *   **Heatmap Correlation:**  Low click-through rates on certain icons.
    *   **Recommendations:** Review icon usage to ensure clarity. Use descriptive labels alongside icons where necessary. Conduct user testing to assess icon comprehension.

#### WCAG Summary
*   **Contrast Ratio:** The current contrast ratio falls below the WCAG AA standard (4.5:1 for normal text).  The low contrast issue identified in Image 1 directly impacts this metric.
*   **Color Blindness:** The design does not adequately account for color blindness, potentially making it difficult for users with these conditions to differentiate elements.
