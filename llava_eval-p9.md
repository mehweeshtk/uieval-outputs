ðŸ“¸ Product Image: The product image showcases the headphones in a visually appealing manner. The close-up shot highlights the details of the Pyson Trac headphones, making them look attractive and inviting to potential customers. ðŸ”— Breadcrumb Links: The breadcrumb links are not clearly visible or distinguishable on the product page, which can make it difficult for users to navigate back to previous sections of the website. This violates the Nielsen Norman Group's principle of "Visibility of System Status" (Heatmap Correlation: Low). Reason: The breadcrumb links are not easily noticeable or distinguishable from other elements on the page, causing confusion for users trying to navigate back to previous sections. Heatmap Correlation: The heatmap data supports this weakness as there is a significant number of dots surrounding the area where the breadcrumb links should be located (Severity: High). Impact: This issue can lead to frustration and decreased user satisfaction, potentially resulting in lost sales or abandoned carts. Recommendations: Improve the visibility of the breadcrumb links by using a contrasting color, larger font size, or adding an icon that represents the breadcrumb trail (WCAG 2.1 - 4.3.2).
