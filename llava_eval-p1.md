* Multiple angles provided for comprehensive view of product
* Green background color enhances visual appeal

#### Weaknesses:

* Breadcrumb links are missing from website, making navigation difficult
* Lack of breadcrumb links violates Nielsen Norman Group's principle of "breadcrumb navigation"
* Heatmap Correlation: No data available to support this weakness
* Severity: High
* Impact: Users may have difficulty navigating the website due to lack of breadcrumb links
* Recommendations: Incorporate breadcrumb navigation into website design, following Nielsen Norman Group's principle. Use HTML <nav> elements with appropriate class names and text labels.
