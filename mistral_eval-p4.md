## Image 3

**Strengths**  
- The product image is large, centrally placed, and visually distinct.  
  ✨ *Heatmap correlation:* The heatmap shows high fixation on the product image, confirming its effectiveness in capturing user attention.

- The product name and price are positioned prominently next to the image.  
  ✨ *Heatmap correlation:* The heatmap data shows significant attention on the product name and price, supporting its importance for user interaction.

**Weaknesses**
