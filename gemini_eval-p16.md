## Image 1

### Strengths
- **Product Image is large and centrally located** üåü
  - High concentration of user gaze on the product image indicates its role in attracting and maintaining attention.
  
- **Product Name and Price are prominently displayed** üí∞
  - Significant user attention around the product name and price suggests they successfully inform users about the product.
  
- **"Add to Basket" button is prominent and centrally located** üõí
  - The heatmap confirms that the button receives significant attention, indicating that users are finding it easily and engaging with it.

### Weaknesses
- **Color Options are represented as small circles with subtle variations** üé®
  - This leads to difficulties in differentiating options, making it hard for users to select their preferred color.
  - Heatmap shows low attention on color options, suggesting users are overlooking these elements.
  - **Severity:** Medium 
  - **Impact:** Users may select colors incorrectly or miss options entirely, leading to frustration and impacting satisfaction.
  - **Recommendations:**
    - Increase size of color swatches and add a bold border or highlight effect to make them more distinguishable. 
    - Improve color contrast between swatches and background to enhance visibility. 
    - Ensure colors are distinctly different to prevent confusion.
  
- **"More Info" link is less prominent and easy to overlook** üîç
  - Smaller font and dull color make this link easy to miss, leading to gaps in user knowledge about the product.
  - Heatmap indicates little user focus on the "More Info" link, suggesting lack of awareness of additional product details.
  - **Severity:** Low 
  - **Impact:** Reduced likelihood of making informed purchase decisions, which can lead to potential frustration.
  - **Recommendations:**
    - Increase font size of the "More Info" link. 
    - Use a bolder color for better contrast, and position it in a more visible area.

### Accessibility Compliance
- The UI meets some WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, but improvements are needed for color contrast and element visibility, particularly for users with visual impairments.

## Image 2

### Strengths
- **Specifications Section is clearly labeled and detailed** üìã
  - Strong focus indicates users actively seek out this information for understanding product features.

### Weaknesses
- **"Add to Basket" button has low visual prominence** üö´
  - Low contrast against the background makes it difficult to locate.
  - Heatmap reveals a relative lack of attention on the button, suggesting users are not engaging with it effectively.
  - **Severity:** High 
  - **Impact:** Decreased likelihood of purchase due to difficulty in locating the button.
  - **Recommendations:**
    - Increase the button's contrast ratio to at least 4.5:1 against the background.
    - Enlarge its size and consider repositioning it near the product image for better visibility.
  
- **Color Options are not easily identifiable** üé®
  - Small, similar circles lack clear affordance leading to inefficient user interaction.
  - Heatmap shows users displayed diffuse attention on color options, indicating potential overlook.
  - **Severity:** Medium 
  - **Impact:** Frustration and potential abandonment of the purchase process.
  - **Recommendations:**
    - Enlarge color swatches and enhance visual cues by using more distinctive color borders or icons to indicate selected states.

### Accessibility Compliance
- UI appears partially compliant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA due to contrast issues in buttons and color selection; adjustments needed to meet standards.

### Strengths
- **Product Image is centrally located and visually appealing** üå†
  - High focus indicates success in capturing user interest.

- **Product Title and Price are prominently placed** üìà
  - Significant engagement points to effectiveness in conveying essential product information.

### Weaknesses

- **Specifications Section uses small text and is densely packed** üìñ
  - Difficult to scan quickly for information, potentially leading to user frustration.
  - Heatmap reveals scattered user attention, indicating low effectiveness in communicating product details.
  - **Severity:** Medium 
  - **Impact:** Harder for users to absorb key information essential for purchasing decisions.
  - **Recommendations:**
    - Increase font size and whitespace in the specifications section to make it more scannable and user-friendly.

### Accessibility Compliance
- Initial assessments suggest the UI partially meets WCAG 2.1 Level A but lacks compliance with aspects relating to color differentiation and contrast.
