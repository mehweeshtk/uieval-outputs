# UI Recommendations Report

## Image 1

### Strengths:
- **Product Image Focus**: Strong attention concentration around the central product image, indicating user engagement with product visualization. üéØ
- **Price Point Visibility**: Notable heat concentration in the pricing area, showing users easily identify key financial information. üí∞
- **Product Title and Features**: Attention is distributed across the product title and key features, confirming that users read relevant information before making a purchase. üìÑ

### Weaknesses:
- **Navigation Elements**:
  - **Reason**: Low attention signature in the heatmap indicates users are not engaging with breadcrumb navigation.
  - **Heatmap Correlation**: Minimal gaze activity suggests users struggle to navigate through product categories.
  - **Severity**: High
  - **Impact**: Poor navigation can lead to user frustration and increased bounce rates.
  - **Recommendations**: 
    - Enhance visibility of navigation by increasing size and contrast against the background.
    - Consider repositioning navigational elements to make them more prominent and user-friendly.

- **Color Selection Options**:
  - **Reason**: Limited attention on color variant selectors despite their importance in customization.
  - **Heatmap Correlation**: Sparse heat signatures indicate users are not exploring color options adequately.
  - **Severity**: Medium
  - **Impact**: Failing to engage users with color selections can result in missed personalization opportunities and decreased satisfaction.
  - **Recommendations**: 
    - Revise color selection interface to include text labels or patterns for better visibility.
    - Increase the size of swatches to draw more attention. 

### WCAG Standards:
- Current partial AA compliance; improvements are necessary for full AA compliance.

## Image 2

### Strengths:
- **Clear CTA Visibility**: The 'Add to basket' button exhibits notable heat concentration, indicating that users recognize it as a critical action point. üõí

### Weaknesses:
- **Limited Visibility of Secondary CTAs**:
  - **Reason**: Buttons such as 'View gallery' and 'See it in action' receive minimal attention.
  - **Heatmap Correlation**: Inadequate visibility in the user flow due to current placement and design.
  - **Severity**: Medium
  - **Impact**: Secondary actions that could further engage users and encourage sharing are being overlooked.
  - **Recommendations**: 
    - Increase visual prominence of secondary CTAs through color differentiations or repositioning them closer to high-traffic areas.

- **Lack of Focus Indicators**:
  - **Reason**: Interactive elements do not display visible focus indicators, impacting navigation for keyboard users.
  - **Heatmap Correlation**: Users with assistive technologies may be unable to effectively engage with the UI.
  - **Severity**: High
  - **Impact**: Poor implementation of focus indicators hampers accessibility and limits user engagement.
  - **Recommendations**: 
    - Implement visible focus states for all interactive elements to meet WCAG standards.

### WCAG Standards:
- Requires enhancements such as labels for color options and increased contrast ratios to achieve full AA compliance.

## Image 3

### Strengths:
- **Product Visualization Clarity**: High concentration of heat markers on the main product image supports its role as the natural focal point. üîç

### Weaknesses:
- **Header Navigation Inefficiency**:
  - **Reason**: Navigation elements receive lower attention than expected.
  - **Heatmap Correlation**: Limited heat signatures in the top navigation imply potential user difficulties in navigating without clearer hierarchies.
  - **Severity**: High
  - **Impact**: Failure to reinforce header navigation could lead to increased user frustration and abandonment.
  - **Recommendations**:
     - Reorganize navigation menu by prioritizing the most important links.
     - Enhance visual hierarchy through size, contrast, and placement.

### WCAG Standards:
- Current AA compliance indicates some areas for improvement in accessibility, including key aspects like focus, text size, and form controls.
