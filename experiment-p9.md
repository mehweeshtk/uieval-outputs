# UI Recommendations and Analysis Report

## Image 1

### Strengths
- **Prominent Product Image**
  - The product image is central and large, effectively drawing user attention.
  - **Heatmap Correlation:** Users focused heavily on the product image, confirming its effectiveness in attracting attention.
  
- **Well-Displayed Product Name and Price**
  - Product name and price use bold typography positioned near the product image, making them focal points.
  - **Heatmap Correlation:** High fixation on the product name and price suggests they capture user attention well.

### Weaknesses
- **Low Text Contrast**
  - **Issue:** Low contrast between text and background in the informational section beside the product image.
  - **Reason:** The issue deviates from UI/UX best practices like WCAG guidelines requiring a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
  - **Heatmap Correlation:** Users showed less interest in this section, likely due to readability issues.
  - **Severity:** Medium
  - **Impact:** Reduced legibility might cause users to overlook important product details.
  - **Recommendations:** Increase text contrast to meet the 4.5:1 requirement. Adjust the background or text color to enhance visibility and legibility.

- **Inconspicuous 'Add to Basket' Button**
  - **Issue:** The 'Add to Basket' button lacks emphasis in design and placement.
  - **Reason:** This does not align with best practice principles like Fitts's Law, as it should be easily discoverable and accessible.
  - **Heatmap Correlation:** Low fixation on the button suggests poor visibility.
  - **Severity:** High
  - **Impact:** Users may struggle to find and interact with the CTA, reducing conversion rates.
  - **Recommendations:** Enhance the button's prominence by using a distinct color with strong contrast and consider repositioning it for higher visibility.

### WCAG Compliance
The UI partially meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. Issues lie in text contrast adjacent to the product image and the prominence of interactive elements like the 'Add to Basket' button.

### Strengths
- **Engaging Product Image**
  - A large product image at the center attracts a lot of user attention.
  - **Heatmap Correlation:** Significant focus on the product image confirms its success in engaging users.
  
- **Effective Typography for Product Details**
  - Bold text of product name and price near the product image works effectively to capture attention.
  - **Heatmap Correlation:** Concentrated user attention verifies these elements engage users as intended.

### Weaknesses
- **Underemphasized Video Link**
  - **Issue:** Low visibility of 'See it in action' video link.
  - **Reason:** This falls short of accessibility and usability standards by not being distinguishable from other content.
  - **Heatmap Correlation:** Minimal attention in heatmap indicates users overlook this element.
  - **Severity:** Medium
  - **Impact:** This reduces user engagement with potentially enhancing content.
  - **Recommendations:** Enhance the visibility by increasing text size and contrast of the video link, and consider more prominent placement just below the product image.

### WCAG Compliance
Partially complies with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. Especially interactive elements like video links require attention to meet standards consistently.

  - **Impact:** Readability issues can lead to user frustration and abandonments.
  - **Recommendations:** Improve contrast to meet WCAG 2.1 standards by adjusting text size and color. This will enhance legibility and user engagement.

- **Complex Navigation Structure**
  - **Issue:** Overcrowded top navigation bar with too many options.
  - **Reason:** This overload of options contradicts Hick's Law by increasing cognitive load.
  - **Heatmap Correlation:** Heatmap indicates scanning behavior, suggesting confusion.
  - **Severity:** High
  - **Impact:** Users may miss crucial navigation links, harming the navigation experience.
  - **Recommendations:** Streamline navigation options by categorizing links under clear headings to reduce complexity and assist in faster decision making.
